    "Pathrise is an online program that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and advice to help job seekers get the best possible jobs in tech. Every two weeks, Pathrise welcomes a new cohort of fellows. If a candidate is interested in joining our program and successfully passes all stages of our admission process, they receive an offer to join Pathrise and become a fellow. The first 2 weeks in the program are called a free trial period and a fellow can withdraw within this free trial period without any penalty. After 2 weeks, a fellow needs to sign an ISA (Income Share Agreement) with us if they want to stay in the program. The entire program lasts up to a year, including 8 weeks of the core curriculum. If a fellow is unable to find a job within a year after joining Pathrise, his/her contract is terminated. However, there might be some exceptions. For instance, if someone was on a break, we may extend their contract for the period of the break. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, for fellows who stay with us after their free trial period, it takes about 4 months to receive a final job offer. However, there is a lot of variation in fellows’ outcomes. Being able to predict how fast every single fellow is going to find a job is crucial for our business.\n",
